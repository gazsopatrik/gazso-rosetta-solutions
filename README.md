# Rosetta Code Solutions by Gazso

This repository contains my personal solutions to [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/) tasks, written in **JavaScript** and **C#**.

Rosetta Code aims to show how the same tasks can be implemented in different programming languages. This helps to understand language differences and similarities and promotes knowledge sharing among programmers.
